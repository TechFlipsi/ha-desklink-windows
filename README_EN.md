**Windows Companion App for Home Assistant** – native, fast, reliable.

Written in **C# / .NET 8** – driverless sensor readings via WMI + PerformanceCounter (no kernel driver needed!).


## Features
- 🌡️ **CPU & GPU Temperature** – driverless via WMI + PerformanceCounter (no WinRing0, no Defender warning!)
- 📊 **All Sensors** – CPU, GPU, RAM, all drives (C:, D:, etc.), Battery, Uptime, VRAM, Audio, Microphone, Webcam, Idle Time
- 🖥️ **Embedded Dashboard** – WebView2 shows HA right in the app (login once, session persists)
- ⚡ **PC Commands from HA** – Shutdown, Restart, Hibernate, Sleep, Lock, Volume, Media Control, and more via notifications
- 📬 **Notifications** – HA sends toast notifications to your PC
- 🔌 **mobile_app Protocol** – identical to the mobile app, no extra HA configuration needed
- 🔄 **Auto-Update** from GitHub Releases
- 📌 **System Tray** – runs minimized in the background
- 🛡️ **Admin Rights** – automatically requested for CPU/GPU temperature

## MQTT (v4.3)

HA DeskLink v4.3 brings **optional MQTT support** for advanced features:

- 🔊 **Media Player Entity** – Your PC appears as a Media Player in Home Assistant with now-playing info, play/pause and volume control
- 📡 **PC Status Binary Sensor** – Instant online/offline detection via Last Will Testament (LWT)
- ⚡ **Commands to Sleeping PC** – MQTT commands reach the PC even in sleep mode
- 🔍 **Automatic Device Discovery** – Media Player and PC Status appear automatically in HA
- 🔒 **More Reliable Connection** – Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- 🪄 **Zero-Config Setup** – On first launch, automatically detects Mosquitto and configures the connection
- 🧭 **Smart Routing** – MQTT for sensors + commands, WebSocket stays for notifications

MQTT is **optional** – HA DeskLink works without MQTT as usual.

## System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (x64)
- No .NET Runtime required – everything included in the installer

## Installation
1. Download the latest `HA_DeskLink_Setup_x.x.x.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/FKirchweger/ha-desklink-dotnet/releases/latest)
2. **Right-click → "Run as Administrator"** ⚠️ A normal double-click or waiting for UAC will cause an error – please start directly via right-click as administrator.
3. Enter HA URL + Long-Lived Token
4. Done! 🎉

## Dashboard

The integrated dashboard opens HA directly in the app (WebView2). On first visit you see the normal HA login form — log in once with username & password, after that the session persists (just like in a browser). If WebView2 is not installed, it automatically offers to download it. Alternatively, HA opens in the default browser.

## Build
```bash
dotnet publish src/HaDeskLink -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -o publish
iscc installer.iss
```

## Technology
| Component | Library |
|---|---|
| Hardware Sensors | WMI + PerformanceCounter (driverless) |
| Dashboard | Microsoft.Web.WebView2 (session login) |
| UI | Windows Forms |
| HTTP | System.Net.Http |
| Config | System.Text.Json |

## v1.x (Python)
The Python version is completed and archived: [ha-desklink](https://github.com/FKirchweger/ha-desklink)

## 📐 Versioning
Starting from v2.2.1, each platform has **independent version numbers**:

| Change | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug Fix** | 2.2.1 → 2.2.2 | Bug fix, affected platform only |
| **New Features** | 2.2.x → 3.0.0 | New features, all platforms simultaneously |

Each platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) has **its own version number**. A bug fix on Linux doesn't change the Windows version – and vice versa. Major feature updates bump all platforms at once.
